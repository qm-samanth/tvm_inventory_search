Step 1: User Enters a Search Query
The user types a natural language search (e.g., “Show me blue SUVs from 2020 under $30000”) into a search box on your web page.
Step 2: Send Query to Backend API
Your JavaScript frontend sends the user’s query to a backend API endpoint (e.g., /api/search) using a POST request.
Step 3: Backend Processes the Query
The backend API receives the query.
It uses LangChain and your local LLM to extract structured parameters (like year, color, body style, price) from the query.
Step 4: Build the Inventory URL
The backend maps the extracted parameters to your inventory search URL as query parameters (e.g., domain.com?year=2020&bodystyle=suv&paymentmax=30000&color=blue).
Step 5: Return URL to Frontend
The backend returns the constructed URL as a JSON response (e.g., { "url": "https://domain.com?year=2020&bodystyle=suv&paymentmax=30000&color=blue" }).
Step 6: Frontend Redirects or Reloads
Your JavaScript receives the URL and reloads or redirects the page to the new URL, displaying the filtered inventory.
